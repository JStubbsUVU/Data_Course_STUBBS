1.    Create a plaintext document named "final_project_idea.txt"

2.    In it, describe your idea for a data analysis final project

I am looking into some data sets on electric vehicles and would like to analyze the range and Kw density of the vehicles. 

3.    Also, Describe the sort of data you will use, potential sources, and what the data might look like
I have found some excel data sets of plug in hybrid (phev) and all electric (BEV) vehicles and it list the make and model along with range and kw size. I am wanting to look into the weight as well. 

4.    (If you already have data, skip this task) Create fake data that simulates what your final project data set might look like. Preferrably a csv file

5.    Generate a plot (using ggplot) using either your real or fake data that shows at least one expected result

The plot is saved and placed under the assignment 4 folder. however it shows that the amont of kw average went up from 2021 to 2022 however, it also made me realize I have an outlier from 2015. I may want to find more data to include older years.
